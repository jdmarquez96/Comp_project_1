# Comp_project_1


To work the code to produce different distribution, just run the code from the command line. (example:  python3 Project_1.py)

As for changing the values, open up the program and manually change the values, which are sig, mean, l, size, and size2. Changing these should change how the distributions look like.

If you do change any of these values, when labeling the histograms, you will have to change the labels as well.
